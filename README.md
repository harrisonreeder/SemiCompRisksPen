The goal of SemiCompRisksPen is to perform penalized estimation of
fraily-based parametric illness-death models for semi-competing risks,
as described in:

Reeder HT, Lu J, Haneuse S. Penalized estimation of frailty‐based
illness–death models for semi‐competing risks. Biometrics. 2023
Sep;79(3):1657-69.
